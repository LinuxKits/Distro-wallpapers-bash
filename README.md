# Distro_wallpapers-CLI-bash 
**A cli client to download and install wallpapers from the project [Distro_Wallpapers](https://github.com/happyeggchen/Distro_wallpapers)**
With this app, you can download, browse, configure nitrojen to install wallpapers - all from the terminal! So that you can manage all the wallpapers from every distro from within your terminal.

This app doesn't affliate with them as this is just a CLI for the [Distro_Wallpapers](https://github.com/happyeggchen/Distro_wallpapers) project which is not owned by me, so if you think any of the wallpapers had your rights harmed please contact @happyeggchen . So I hope that I'm clear with this.
